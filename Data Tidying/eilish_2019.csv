Billie Eilish,2019,"Why? Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. Oh my God. So many other songs deserve this. I’m sorry. Thank you so much. This is my first Grammy’s. I never thought this would ever happen in my whole life. I grew up watching them and this is my brother, Finneas, and he’s my best friend. I feel like I joke around a lot and I never take anything seriously at these kinds of things, but I genuinely want to say I’m so grateful and I only want to say that I’m grateful and that I’m so honored to be here amongst all of you. I love you to my core. I grew up watching all of you. Thank you to my team, my mom, my dad, my best friends Drew and Zooey for keeping me alive to this day, Justin, Danny, Brandon, Michelle, Chelsea, Spencer, you say some please."
